constraints-based modeling of nitrogen oxide fluxes during co-culture of Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter winogradskyi.
In review.

Note Added 10/21/2019:  Updated model files were uploaded to reflect the most recent SBML fbc format.  These reformatted model files will not work with the original Matlab microBiome-v2.1 model without additional coding changes.
